<script current="true">Latn</script><abstract><p>The <eref type="inline" bibitemid="OGC" citeas="OGC">OGC</eref> provides a collaborative, consensus process for developing and approving open, international standards for the geospatial domain. "International standards" (as defined in <eref type="inline" bibitemid="ISODIR2" citeas="ISO/IEC Guide 2 (all parts)">ISO/IEC Guide 2 (all parts)</eref>) are those adopted by an international standardizing/standards organization and made available to the public. Specifically, an OGC standard is:</p>
<p>A document, established by consensus and approved by the OGC Membership, that provides, for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results, aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context.</p>
<p>To guide an open standards development and approval process, a member approved Policies and Procedures is required.</p>
<p>This document describes the OGC Technical Committee (TC) policies and procedures (P&amp;P). The TC has been granted authority to operate by the OGC Bylaws. The TC is composed of individuals representing organizations that are duly recognized members in good standing of the OGC. The Technical Committee Chair (TCC - see <xref target="role-of-the-technical-committee-chair-tcc">Clause 2.2</xref>) facilitates the TC process.</p>
<p>The TC P&amp;P:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Documents all TC voting processes and procedures;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documents the formation, scope and processes required for TC subgroup and committee activities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documents the processes and procedures for submitting, reviewing, and approving a new standard using the Request for Comment procedures; and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Documents the process for revisions to adopted OGCÂ® standards.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>As the needs and purpose of the TC change, these policies and procedures changes are approved by an electronic vote of the Voting Members of OGC TC or by recommendation of the OGC Planning Committee (PC). These policies and procedures may be augmented or clarified by Policy Directives issued and approved by the TC or the PC. Such directives are databased and hyperlinked to/from the appropriate portion of this document.</p>
<p>The OGC Technical Committee provides an open, collaborative forum for professional discussion related to the consensus development and/or evaluation, approval, and revision of OGC international standards. The primary use of approved OGC standards is to provide the ability to build and deploy interoperable geospatial solutions in the larger Information Technology (IT) domain.</p>

<p id="_64680f8d-b7af-4f10-a816-3919e460ef21">Community standard: This is a document, developed by communities external to the OGC, such as GeoRSS, that OGC members wish to bring into the OGC process. The key consideration for a Community standard submission is that there is very strong evidence of implementation. At the same time, the community owning the standard may not want to allow normative changes (except for errors) to the document, may not wish to follow the OGC Modular Specification Policy, nor do they wish to develop CITE tests. Please visit <xref target="policies-for-the-request-for-comment-rfc-process">Clause 6.4</xref> and <xref target="annex-c---community-standard">Annex B</xref> to read more about the requirements for submitting a Community standard as well as a checklist of steps in the Community standard submission, review, and approval process.</p>

<p id="_578151b8-3c89-464d-a906-9ff1e76cac47">Standard: This is a document developed by the OGC membership, such as in a Testbed or in a SWG, for which there is no evidence of implementation or CITE tests. However, the members wish to approve the document as an official OGC document in order to have developers and organizations implement the standard and provide feedback. A standard may at some time be moved forward for approval as a standard with Compliance Suite or it may remain as a standard.</p>
<p id="_984feace-8afa-4b5b-819f-7a3989945b2c">Standard with Compliance Suite: This is a mature OGC standard for which there is evidence of implementation and for which Compliance tests exist. A standard with Compliance Suite may start as a Community standard or as a standard.</p>
<clause id="two-track-standards-process-criteria" obligation="normative"><title depth="3">6.2.1.<tab/>Two Track Standards Process Criteria</title><p id="_b92cfb55-6390-4bec-8e96-e6835f9fc920">Evidence of implementation: The TC will judge whether the evidence of implementation for a particular Community standard or standard with Compliance Suite is sufficient to warrant approval of that standard. Strong evidence of implementation as required for the Community standard is generally defined to be implementation in multiple products or environments OR widespread use of the standard in a community, even if in only one or a limited number of products or environments. Evidence of implementation for a standard with Compliance Suite is defined as three or more documented implementations that collectively implement all mandatory requirements of the standard. The TC may choose to override the minimum number of reference implementations for a specific candidate standard by specifying a lesser number in the electronic adoption vote.</p>
<p id="_152094b7-c6c0-464c-988b-5e76f1338c38">Modular Specification: compliance with the Modular Specification is evidenced by inclusion of clearly defined Requirements and an Abstract Test Suite in the standard document. The OAB will evaluate a standard against this criterion.</p>
<p id="_d0daa9fa-9001-47dd-bf30-53d021834817">Compliance Test: a compliance test for an Implementation standard is defined to be an OGC CITE test suite complete for all mandatory requirements in the standard. A compliance test for a Conceptual Model is defined as an approved OGC standard that encodes against the Conceptual Model and which itself has CITE tests.</p>
<p id="_2007e371-9817-4084-9bdb-705ad9071b96">IPR: Community standard may contain IPR that is jointly held by the OGC and the submitting organization. The Full Standards track requires that OGC hold the IPR.</p></clause>

This is the approach for proposing a new candidate standard, submitting an externally developed community specification into the OGC process, extensions to an existing standard, profiles of an existing standard, or an application schema for consideration by the membership. For the Full Standards track, a SWG manages the RFC process.</p>
<p id="_e62e9883-fe95-4446-966c-03c321254c88">Please note: A new standards activity can also be initiated when there are outstanding change request proposals. Change Request Proposals (CRPs) (<xref target="change-request-proposals-crp-to-an-ogc-document">Clause 6.8</xref>) provide details for revisions to existing Abstract Specifications or standards. A CRP describes proposed changes or enhancements to an existing standard. A CRP may be submitted by one or more OGC member organizations. One or more CRs against an existing OGC standard is evidence that a revision process for that standard should be initiated. In this case, the TCC may request members consider a standards activity using the RFC process.</p>
