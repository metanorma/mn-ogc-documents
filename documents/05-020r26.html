Specifically, an OGC standard is:</p>
        <p id="_036c72d4-41cc-4877-ad9e-c183dfe2fe49">A document, established by consensus and approved by the OGC Membership, that provides, for common and repeated use, rules, guidelines or characteristics for activities or their results, aimed at the achievement of the optimum degree of order in a given context.</p>

The TC has been granted authority to operate by the OGC Bylaws. The TC is composed of individuals representing organizations that are duly recognized members in good standing of the OGC.

<p id="_89871dfb-ed2c-4946-8a96-e0263630491c">The following policies address voting during and between TC meetings. One of the primary functions of the TC is to vote on a variety of actions, items, and issues. Votes can be for any purpose pertaining to the format and content of the Abstract Specification, Candidate standards, OGC standards, Discussion Papers, approval of the slate of nominations for the OGC Architecture Board, Best Practices Documents, Policies and Procedures of the TC, and for other purposes consistent with the purpose of the TC as described in these Policies and Procedures. The TC will make recommendations to the PC concerning adoption of a candidate standard, changes to a standard, creation of a Working Group, a Best Practice, or a policy document and these recommendations require further approval by the PC.</p></div>

<p id="_32dc2fc1-ca8e-4a70-b86e-eb8444e9d4df">The only exception for this Quorum rule is for a vote to issue an electronic vote for adoption of a new or revised version of a candidate standard, creation of a Working Group, a Best Practice, or a policy document.

The TC may override the 3-week rule by a 2/3-majority vote of Voting TC members in attendance at a meeting.</p>
<p id="_dec3c348-ec6a-4856-a50a-1bcf328e8c87">The three-week rule clause ensures that Voting TC members have adequate time to read, distribute and gather comments on documents before voting on the document at the following TC meeting.</p></div>

This interest may lead to the formation of a new OGC Working Group. The following are the usual steps related to the formation of a new WG. Typically, the first step is to call an ad-hoc meeting at a face-to-face TC meeting. An ad-hoc meeting is to 1.) judge interest in forming the new sub-group and 2.) define the scope of work for the proposed new sub-group.</p>

Like any sub-group, they shall schedule a meeting time and post the meeting time information on the OGC Portal Calendar. Also, like any other sub-group meeting of the TC, they shall announce the meeting to the broader TC and communicate an agenda. At this Ad-hoc meeting, the participants continue to frame the mission and the scope for a proposed new WG or other OGC activity. They must also determine whether there is adequate Member interest to actually form a new WG.</p>

<p id="_fe81a7c5-f56e-4ed9-8e06-ac5382c60860">Quorum for votes on any items or issues brought before a SWG is based on the number of voting members for that SWG. Insuring quorum at SWG meetings is a vital aspect of the SWG being able to complete its work in a timely manner. Therefore, any SWG voting member who misses two consecutive SWG meetings (teleconference, face to face, or webinar) in which votes occur or misses two consecutive email votes shall be deemed as inactive and will not count toward quorum after the second missed vote. The SWG Chair shall take roll call at the beginning of each meeting and determine quorum based on active voting members only. An inactive SWG voting member can become active again simply by attending the SWG meetings and participating. If regular attendance by a given voting member is an issue, that voting member may assign a temporary or permanent proxy to another SWG voting member or to the SWG Chair. The voting member may rescind that proxy at any time. If the voting member wishes not to assign their proxy, they can ask to change their status to &#x201C;Observer&#x201D; and still actively participate in the SWG.</p></div>

<p id="_c68cd80a-8433-4db4-9cf0-83aa584f0d44">The TC e-vote is to recommend to the PC approval of the results of an adoption vote.

Further, for candidate standards developed external to the OGC and submitted into the OGC process, the PC may verify that the submitting organization has provided a duly executed submission of technology form. In addition, the TC recommends acceptance contingent on the PC&#x2019;s finding that the sponsoring organization(s) makes the technology available as per the OGC Intellectual Property Policies and Procedures.</p>

In those cases in which backwards compatibility cannot be achieved, the SWG will insure that all inconsistencies are highlighted and documented.

Release notes document all enhancements, changes, and compatibility issues resulting from the revision of the interface standard. Both the TC and the PC reserve the right to review the issues related to backwards compatibility for a given revision of a standard.
