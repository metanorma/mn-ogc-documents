        <p id="_e83aedfb-3a93-44ae-aba0-c5b76f61c5ea">A broad definition of a consortium is: a combination or group of organizations formed to undertake a common objective that is beyond the resources or capabilities of any single organization. The OGC was formed to provide a collaborative, consensus forum for the discussion and resolution of interoperability issues in the geospatial domain. The work of the consortium is based on volunteerism.</p>
        <p id="_f8936617-9ec8-46ec-b01a-4c291b24acb9">More specifically in the standards area, a consortium has the following characteristics:</p>

<li>
<p id="_c66794e0-b9c8-4f40-8fb0-3a02b6c1d8de">Has as its primary goal(s) the creation and/or promotion of international standards (most commonly in the IT area);</p>

<p id="_f4a60c9c-7d03-4eac-856a-3bd297d0afc8">Creates what would be acknowledged to be &#x201C;open&#x201D; standards made available on Reasonable and Non-Discriminatory (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reasonable_and_non-discriminatory_licensing/">RAND</a>) terms; and</p>

<p id="_8621104b-12c5-4199-9f46-b7c58ccf8d52">Only members of the OGC, Invited Speakers, and Invited Guests are welcome at TC meetings. Any TC member may send another representative of his or her organization as a substitute to a TC meeting (please note <a href="#proxy-for-voting">Clause 5.3.4</a>). Subgroups may only meet by being formally scheduled by the TCC or designee during the course of regularly scheduled TC meetings (subgroups cannot have alternative meetings that overlap temporally with the TC Meeting without approval of the TCC or PC).</p>

Reasons for invitations may be to provide technical input, speak (see Policy for Invited Speakers below), or meet with OGC members and/or staff on items and issues germane to the work of the OGC.</p>
<p id="_ddf89d33-f8ae-4aef-9972-deb4c3c797f2">Invited Guests (representatives of organizations that are not members of the TC) may actively participate in an OGC meeting at the sole discretion of the TCC. That is, in the interests of ensuring the efficient operation of any meeting, the TCC may limit or eliminate the opportunity of any invited guest to participate in discussion at any meeting.</p>
<p id="_d2ec8586-9ac6-4ac0-8e0f-12dad2e573d1">All Invited Guest invitations and registration must be coordinated with the TCC and the OGC staff responsible for meeting logistics. The steps are very similar to those for Invited Speakers.</p>

</ul>
<p id="_56e92e26-9c05-4f00-9f37-7a7e9c410fa7">The Invited Guest may or may not have to pay a meeting registration fee. OGC staff will work with the members to determine the fee structure for Invited Guests for any given TC meeting.</p></div>

The agenda is managed solely by the TCC or designee and will be modified prior to the meeting as appropriate. The TCC will maintain a master agenda that is available to members and which is generated from the agendas of each WG as they are populated.</p>
<p id="_8d9ebaf2-2435-4619-9b28-07b826defc46">The WG Chairs shall provide the TCC or designee meeting date and time requests at least 4 weeks before the actual TC meeting. The earlier the better!</p>
<p id="_1cc310a4-e61c-4462-b15d-7c32df2f326f">Each WG Chair shall email an agenda to OGC members at least three weeks before the meeting. Due to schedule conflicts, WG Chairs that fail to provide a proposed agenda by three weeks before the meeting may forfeit the right to meet during the course of regularly scheduled TC meeting times. However, the Chairs of a WG that do not provide an agenda can elect to have an ad-hoc meeting during the off-hours (such as a breakfast or after dinner session).</p></div>

If there is quorum, then a simple majority of the Voting TC Members present at a meeting shall constitute a positive vote for all TC Items and Issues. A roll call will be held at the beginning of each Plenary where votes are to occur to ensure a quorum is present.</p>
<p id="_d13f1af3-4779-40a2-82ad-2ff9ce85a13a">The only exception for this Quorum rule is for a vote to issue an electronic vote for adoption of a new or revised version of a candidate standard, creation of a Working Group, a Best Practice, or a policy document.

<p id="_6e8edd1d-2c5c-47b2-b2ae-b7091fd74d95">The three-week rule clause ensures that Voting TC members have adequate time to read, distribute and gather comments on documents before voting on the document at the following TC meeting.</p></div>

Also, like any other sub-group meeting of the TC, they shall announce the meeting to the broader TC and communicate an agenda.

<p id="_403eb214-b335-4c5f-b784-7ac2938bfcd9">SWGs operate under the same general voting rules as other sub-groups of the TC, namely Votes in an SWG follow the same guidelines as for the Technical Committee except that quorum is 1/2 of active voting members (see <a href="#caveat-on-voting-rights-if-you-do-not-participate-on-a-regular-basis">Clause 6.7.9</a>) unless the SWG votes to have a larger fraction be quorum. See <a href="#subgroups-of-the-tc-electronic-voting">Clause 5.5</a> for electronic votes for sub-groups of the TC. The one notable exception related to SWG votes is that only member representatives who have opted into the SWG may vote.</p>

If you do not participate in the teleconferences and email discussions and vote on items and issues, you will lose your voting privileges and have your SWG member status changed from &#x201C;Voting&#x201D; to &#x201C;Group Member&#x201D;. The SWG Chair has the authority and the ability to make these changes based on the following policy.</p>
<p id="_384f4427-4eb6-45c5-b351-0c4ecb46adfc">Quorum for votes on any items or issues brought before a SWG is based on the number of voting members for that SWG. Insuring quorum at SWG meetings is a vital aspect of the SWG being able to complete its work in a timely manner. Therefore, any SWG voting member who misses two consecutive SWG meetings (teleconference, face to face, or webinar) in which votes occur or misses two consecutive email votes shall be deemed as inactive and will not count toward quorum after the second missed vote. The SWG Chair shall take roll call at the beginning of each meeting and determine quorum based on active voting members only. An inactive SWG voting member can become active again simply by attending the SWG meetings and participating. If regular attendance by a given voting member is an issue, that voting member may assign a temporary or permanent proxy to another SWG voting member or to the SWG Chair. The voting member may rescind that proxy at any time. If the voting member wishes not to assign their proxy, they can ask to change their status to &#x201C;Observer&#x201D; and still actively participate in the SWG.</p></div>

<p id="_f6ea19dd-dcfe-45d1-98d8-3893d52c813e">Many technical issues discussed in a SWG will require collaboration and communication with other SWGs. As long as the voting members agree to such cross SWG communication, then an open dialogue between two or more SWGs can occur on any specific technical issue.</p>

<div id="_swg_work_environment"><h3>6.7.11.&#xA0; SWG Work Environment</h3><p id="_9e69707a-2cce-4da7-aa2a-a5dae361dac0">SWGs are expected to maintain their Portal records in a complete fashion, including presentations made at SWG meetings. Presentations in TC Meetings which the SWG permits to be viewed by general OGC membership should be stored in the TC Meeting folder for that SWG or in the SWG Portal project files with a symbolic link to the TC Meeting folder. All draft documents for SWG discussion should be in the SWG files until that point those documents are to be discussed in the TC. SWG documents for TC discussion or voting are to be uploaded to Pending Documents.</p>

A SWG may also vote to allow non-OGC members to participate in the development of the standard in the collaboration environment. Note that such a vote does not grant access to non-members to the OGC Portal nor does it give those non-members voting rights for SWG approval of any work.</p>
<p id="_8509f1bf-76a5-4705-a834-a033ea03ff74">The collaboration environment will be under ultimate control of the OGC. For example, OGC maintains organizational structures in GitHub and SVN under which SWGs can create a project for their use. Non-OGC private repositories or projects may not be used for development of SWG deliverables.</p>
<p id="_613bcf0f-dcb4-4fb4-b866-2548fbd966a7">The collaboration environment must clearly display a message on its home page (e.g., the README file in GitHub) that states the contributions to the work in the collaboration environment belong to OGC, as shown below.</p>

Please remember that there is the official formal 30-day public comment period. However, a SWG is encouraged to release an in-progress document early in the process in order to solicit input from the community. If a SWG votes to release a document for early public comment, it must coordinate with OGC Communications to generate a press release and properly create the Request For Comments (RFC) on the OGC website.</p>

The new work can result in an update, extension, or profile of a standard.</p>
<p id="_02decb49-a185-4f91-8cf6-cfb0637b92fd">The proposed Task must be presented to the TC at a plenary. Otherwise, a PowerPoint or video presentation will be developed and posted to the Portal. This presentation should cover the key aspects of the Task, especially the scope of work, the timeline, and the technical discussion related how the work relates to the standard(s) developed by the SWG.</p>
<p id="_feb14f5c-ecbd-45d3-8a0b-08b347cab707">Once the proposed Task has been presented to the TC, the TCC will initiate a 21 day TC and public review of the proposed Task.

<p id="_2ef18a0a-4018-4231-ac00-0d0964be9f14">The proposed Task will be voted upon by TC Voting Members in a Closing Plenary (see <a href="#voting-at-tc-meetings">Clause 5.3</a>) or by a two-week email vote (see <a href="#tc-or-subgroups-of-the-tc-email-voting">Clause 5.6</a>).

<li>
<p id="_e21256ad-1945-4ce5-b956-b87803a4add2">Revisions to an adopted standard typically result in a change to the minor number. For example, the first revision to an adopted 1.0 standard would be 1.1.0. Minor revision releases should be 100% backwards compatible with the previous version.</p>

Further, for candidate standards developed external to the OGC and submitted into the OGC process, the PC may verify that the submitting organization has provided a duly executed submission of technology form. In addition, the TC recommends acceptance contingent on the PC&#x2019;s finding that the sponsoring organization(s) makes the technology available as per the OGC Intellectual Property Policies and Procedures.<a class="FootnoteRef" href="#fn:21" id="fnref:21"><sup>21</sup></a></p></div>

Strong evidence of implementation as required for the Community standard is generally defined to be implementation in multiple products or environments OR widespread use of the standard in a community, even if in only one or a limited number of products or environments. Evidence of implementation for a standard in the Full standards track is defined as three or more documented implementations that meet the Nature of implementation criteria, below. The TC may choose to override the minimum number of implementations for a specific candidate standard by specifying a lesser number in the electronic adoption vote.</p>
<p id="_827be76e-ca81-4a7a-bc10-d2edfc3c94c4">Nature of implementation: API, service, and exchange protocol standards shall have as evidence of implementation running services which deliver content to another machine (including client software). Encoding standards shall have as evidence of implementation data sets containing content representative of the standard, but not necessarily containing an example of every element in the standard.</p>
<p id="_75bfaf75-e0b3-462f-9ab7-023a25b3a290">Conceptual model evidence of implementation: a standard that is conceptual in nature (e.g., cannot be implemented directly) and not being advanced as an Abstract Specification Topic shall only be advanced from a Draft to a final stage once at least one implementation standard based on the conceptual model is approved at the Draft stage.</p>
<p id="_5bf795ce-8375-424d-9ea7-7b3bc5fa8aeb">Abstract Specification Topics: these standards do not require evidence of implementation due to their foundational nature. Abstract Specification Topics are approved as standards without a Draft stage.</p>
<p id="_2f3995e9-2d99-4569-bf69-8c27b3d7c195">Modular Specification: compliance with the Modular Specification is evidenced by inclusion of clearly defined Requirements and an Abstract Test Suite in the standard document. The OAB will evaluate a standard against this criterion.</p>
<p id="_8113d8f9-e9d7-4506-b4c3-fd8f5053b6a3">IPR: Community standard may contain IPR that is jointly held by the OGC and the submitting organization. The Full standards track requires that OGC hold the IPR.</p></div>

The existence of these groups can be misleading to those trying to understand what OGC is currently doing. This proposal suggests a mechanism for reviewing subgroups and taking some action when appropriate. This will help ensure the groups in OGC are aligned with the actual work being done within the TC.</p>
